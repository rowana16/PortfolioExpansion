        <h5>Custom Delegates</h5>
        <p>
            Delegates are the pipe between an event and an event handler. <br />
            They not only provide the path but also the requirements of the event handler, <br />
            ensuring the information provided by the event is sufficient for the handler to perform the required action.<br />
            <b>Delegates are typically ended with 'Handler'</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            By placing the delegate call in a separate method which accepts any delegate, you get some real freedom in which delegate you want to call.
